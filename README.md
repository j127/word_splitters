# Word Splitters

Some rough example Python code for splitting up text into various types of words.

* `word_splitter.py`: Splits text file into "words" along whitespace.
* `extract_and_pad_words.py`: Splits text file into alphanumeric words and add space padding.
* `find_words_and_spaces.py`: Splits text file into alphabetic words, but preserve adjacent whitespace as it appears in the original.
